<h1>Day 1 - Parsing People - Part B</h1>
<p>This is a continuation of Part A</p>
<p>After the success of the previous event, ACM decided to host another string<br />
parsing workshop. People must really love strings!</p>
<p>They decided to keep their strict security policy of logging all of people<br />
coming in and out of the event.</p>
<p>ACM expected an even higher turnout than last time.<br />
One unpaid security intern wasn’t enough, so this time they had three!</p>
<ul>
<li>Firewall Frankie</li>
<li>Cryptography Claire</li>
<li>Hacker Hank</li>
</ul>
<p>Firewall Frankie is a perfectionist and has perfect memory. Any logs from<br />
Frankie contain all of the names of the people passing by.</p>
<p>Crypography Claire is new and doesn’t know anyone’s names. She just writes down<br />
the number of people she saw walk through.</p>
<p>Hacker Hank is lazy and doesn’t want to write down all the names. He writes<br />
the name of the first person he saw in each group, and then writes the<br />
number of people that followed.</p>
<p>All three of the unpaid security interns keep their logs in the same file.</p>
<p>You’ve once again been asked to find the maximum number of people that were in<br />
the room at one time.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains an integer <code>n</code>, representing total number of lines in the log.</p>
<p>The next <code>n</code> following lines each contain a phrase describing what the security<br />
interns saw. Each phrase will be in one of three formats.</p>
<p>Names are case-sensitive and contain only alphabetic characters, with no spaces.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>What was the maximum number of people in the room at one time?</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
