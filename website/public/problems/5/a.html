<h1>Day 5 - Tax Brackets - Part A</h1>
<h3 id="next-part"><a href="/problems/5/b">Go to part b</a></h3>
</group>
<p>Tax season is coming up your uncle Charlie Taylor is doing his taxes.</p>
<p>He hates technology and refuses to use any online tools to help him calculate his taxes.<br />
Hes asked if you could help him calculate how much he paid in taxes this year!</p>
<p>Tax brackets work by dividing your income into ranges, and you are only taxed<br />
at the specified rate for the income that falls within each range. Any income<br />
that falls above a certain range is taxed at a higher rate, while income that<br />
falls below a certain range is taxed at a lower rate or not taxed at all.</p>
<p>Charlie has also requested that you don’t count any checks that are $100 or less!<br />
The IRS will never find out!</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<h5><a href="/inputs/5/a/" target="_blank">Click here to get your input!</a></h5>
<p>The first line contains an integer <code>b</code>, the number of tax brackets.<br />
The second line contains an integer <code>n</code>, the number of paychecks that contribute to Charlie’s taxable income.<br />
The following <code>b</code> lines each contain two amounts of money <code>bmin</code> and <code>bmax</code> and a percentage <code>rate</code></p>
<p>Any income in the range of <code>bmin</code> and <code>bmax</code> will be taxed at <code>rate</code></p>
<p>The following <code>n</code> lines each contain an amount of money <code>m</code><br />
This means Charlie received a check of amount <code>m</code> that contributes towards his taxable income.</p>
