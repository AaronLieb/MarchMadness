<h1>Day 1 - Parsing People - Part A</h1>
<h3 id="next-part"><a href="/problems/1/b">Go to part b</a></h3>
</hgroup>
<p>ACM at CSUF hosted a workshop on string parsing.</p>
<p>There was a huge turnout, and we enforced a strict security<br />
policy, requiring each person to go through a security check-in before entering<br />
or leaving the event.</p>
<p>To help us keep track of everyone, we brought on an unpaid security intern.<br />
This intern was very diligent and didn’t miss a single person, and kept logs of<br />
every time someone entered or exited.</p>
<p>Now, the CSUF Computer Science department needs to know how large of a room to<br />
book for future events, and they’ve asked for the maximum number of people who<br />
were in the room at any one time during the workshop.</p>
<p>That’s where you come in! We’re enlisting your exceptional computer programming<br />
skills to help us parse through the logs and find the answer to this important<br />
question.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains an integer <code>n</code>, representing total number of lines in the log.</p>
<p>The next <code>n</code> following lines each contain a phrase describing what the security<br />
intern saw. Each phrase will be in the format “[name] entered/left the room”.</p>
<p>Names are case-sensitive and contain only alphabetic characters, with no spaces.</p>
<p>No two people have the same name. A person can enter and exit a room as many<br />
times as they like, but cannot exit the room if they are not inside of it.</p>
