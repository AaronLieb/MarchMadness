# Day 2 - Patterns in Ï€ - Part A


It's Pi day and your physics professor is giving the class an extra credit
assignment.

Write a program that takes two inputs: a string representing the decimal
expansion of Pi (up to at most 3141 decimal places, with a minimum of 777 digits), and a three-digit
integer. The program should first count the number of times the three-digit
integer occurs in the Pi string, and then count the number of times that count
occurs in the Pi string as well. Return the final count as the output.

## Input
A string S representing the decimal expansion of Pi
A three-digit integer N (e.g. 123, 456, 789)
